                            Sports have always been a fundamental part of my life. They teach me discipline, teamwork, 
                            perseverance, and the importance of continuous improvement—values that I also apply to my 
                            professional development as an engineer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe that a healthy mind and body are essential for success in any field. Whether playing 
                            football, running, or exploring new outdoor activities, sports keep me motivated and energized 
                            to tackle the challenges of my studies and projects.

                        <p>
                            Technology has fascinated me since childhood. The ability to create solutions that impact 
                            millions of users through code is what drives my passion for Computer Science. From low-level 
                            GPU programming to distributed systems, I'm constantly exploring new domains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm particularly interested in parallel computing, software architecture, and solving 
                            computational problems at scale. The intersection of hardware and software optimization is 
                            where I find the greatest challenge and satisfaction.

                        <p>
                            I am proud to come from Spain, a country with a rich cultural heritage, vibrant traditions, 
                            and a diverse landscape. Born in Huércal-Overa, Almería, a beautiful region in southeastern Spain, 
                            I've grown up surrounded by Mediterranean culture and history.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Spanish Culture & Traditions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Spain is known for its warmth, passion, and deep-rooted traditions. From family gatherings to 
                            regional festivals, culture plays a central role in Spanish life. The values of community, 
                            friendship, and celebration are embedded in our DNA.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Flavors of Spain</h3>
                        <p>
                            Spanish cuisine is world-renowned for its simplicity and quality. Dishes like paella, gazpacho, 
                            and jamón ibérico reflect our agricultural heritage and Mediterranean influence. Spanish food 
                            is not just sustenance—it's an experience shared with loved ones, often enjoyed during long, 
                            meaningful conversations.

                            Huércal-Overa, my hometown in Almería, is a charming town in the heart of southeastern Spain. 
                            Almería, as a province, is known for its stunning Mediterranean beaches, dramatic landscapes, 
                            and agricultural prowess—particularly in greenhouse farming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Growing up in Almería has shaped who I am: resilient, connected to nature, and appreciative of 
                            simple yet quality things. The region's mix of tradition and innovation mirrors my approach to 
                            technology and life.
